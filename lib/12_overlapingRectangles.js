/*
    The overlapping Rectangles practices your ability to represent a grid using nested arrays
    Given input of 2 array of arrays represeting two rectangles on a x-y grid, find the overlapping area of the two rectangles
    The first element of each array represent the indices of the lower left corner of a rectangle, 
    and the 2nd element represent the indices, upper right corner of the rectangle
    On a x-y grid, a square retangle that has edge length of 2 starting from [0,0] would be represented as such: [[0,0], [2,2]]
    Example: overlappingRectangles([[0,0], [2,2]], [[1,1], [3,3]]) should return 1;
